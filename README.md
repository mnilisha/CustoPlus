## Problem Statement
Startups are growing in India and abroad. With the founders hustling to increase their customer network , meaningful data analysis will help them underdstand their target customers and give them insights on customer retention. But then data analysis becomes a bit tough for non technical persons ... Hiring a data scientist is not always feasible. Whats the solution ?

## Solution

Hola ! Open up custoplus , upload your data and analyse your data with our exploratory data analysis pipelines.
Whats more ? Well with numerous pre built plots with the click of a button you get full insights on customer behaviour based on region, age, gender, credit card usage and lot more depending on your columns.

Most importantly custoplus integrates machine learnine pipelines of knn,random forest and svm to predict if any new customer will stay or not based on other
parameters.

## Auto Data Analysis and Auto ml

Auto ml and Auto Data Analysis requires a lot of brainstorming. A solution that works for one dataset may not work for the other . The main challenge we faced was integrating Custoplus to be flexible with all datasets . We have used intelligent solutions in the backend taking parameters like column data type, unique values , nature of values,mean among others to help in automation. Nan Values and outliers have been dealth with in a quite different way . The next problem comes to handle errors when it comes to different types of datasets .
